     3,418 Comments Jump To Recipe Sally disclosure policy With 11 million page views and counting since 2013, these super soft and chewy chocolate chip cookies are the most popular cookie recipe on my website. Melted butter, more brown sugar than white sugar, cornstarch, and an extra egg yolk guarantee the absolute chewiest chocolate chip cookie texture. And you donâ€™t even need a mixer! Reader Adrienne commented: â€œThese are the best cookies Iâ€™ve ever had. Incredible. Donâ€™t cut corners or youâ€™ll miss out. Do everything she says and youâ€™re in for the best cookies of your life. â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â€œ There are thousands of chocolate chip cookies recipes out there. Everyone has their favorite and this one is mine. Just a glance at the hundreds of reviews in the comments section tells me that this recipe is a favorite for many others too! In fact, if you asked me which recipe to keep in your apron pocket, my answer would be this one. (In addition to a classic cut-out sugar cookies and flaky pie crust, of course!) Just read the comments on a post in our Facebook group. These cookies are lovedâ€¦ and, warning: they disappear FAST. sugar cookies pie crust post in our Facebook group The recipe is also included in two of my published cookbooks (in Sallyâ€™s Baking Addiction, I swap chocolate chips for M&Ms/chocolate chips combo). published cookbooks MY LATEST VIDEOS Why Are These My BEST Chocolate Chip Cookies? The chewiest of chewy and the softest of soft. Extra thick just like my favorite peanut butter cookies! peanut butter cookies Bakery-style BIG. Exploding with chocolate. Back in 2013, I tested this cookie recipe over and over again to make sure theyâ€™re absolutely perfect. I still have a big space in my heart (and stomach) for these Soft Chocolate Chip Cookies. Todayâ€™s recipe is similar, but I increased the chewiness factor. Soft Chocolate Chip Cookies Reader A.Phillips commented: â€œLook no further. This is it. This is the perfect cookie recipe. Follow her instructions exactly and the cookies will be chewy and amazing. â€¦ These are the most perfect cookies Iâ€™ve made and Iâ€™ve tried at least 20 different recipes. â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â€œ You can make them with chocolate chips or chocolate chunks. Key Ingredients for Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies The cookie dough is made from your standard cookie ingredients: flour, leavener, salt, sugar, butter, egg, and vanilla. Itâ€™s the ratios and temperature of those ingredients that make this recipe stand out from the rest.Â  Melted butter: Melted butter produces the chewiest cookies. It can, however, make your baked cookies greasy, so I made sure there is enough flour to counteract that. And using melted butter is also the reason you donâ€™t need a mixer to make these cookies, just like these pumpkin chocolate chip cookies and M&M cookie bars. pumpkin chocolate chip cookies M&M cookie bars More brown sugar than white sugar: More brown sugar than white sugar: The moisture in brown sugar promises an extra soft and chewy baked cookie. White granulated sugar is still necessary, though. Itâ€™s dry and helps the cookies spread. A little bit of spread is a good thing. Cornstarch: Why? Cornstarch gives the cookies that ultra soft consistency we all love. Plus, it helps keep the cookies beautifully thick. We use the same trick when making shortbread cookies. shortbread cookies Egg yolk: Another way to promise a super chewy chocolate chip cookie is to use an extra egg yolk. The extra egg yolk adds richness, soft tenderness, and binds the dough. You will need 1 egg + 1 egg yolk, at room temperature. See the recipe Notes for how to bring your eggs to room temperature quickly. The dough will be soft and the chocolate chips may not stick because of the melted butter. Just keep stirring it; I promise it will come together. Because of the melted butter and extra egg yolk, the slick dough doesnâ€™t even look like normal cookie dough! Trust the processâ€¦ The most important step is next. 2 Major Success Tips 1. Chill the dough. Chilling the cookie dough is so important in this recipe! Unless you want the cookies to spread into a massive cookie puddle, chilling the dough is mandatory here. It allows the ingredients to settle together after the mixing stage but most importantly: cold dough results in thicker cookies.Â Cover the cookie dough and chill for at least 2â€“3 hours and even up to 3â€“4 days.  After chilling, the dough is quite solid, so let it sit at room temperature for 10 minutes (to soften it up slightly) before shaping. (No time to chill? Make these soft & chewy chocolate chip cookie bars instead!) chocolate chip cookie bars Further reading: How to Prevent Cookies from Spreading How to Prevent Cookies from Spreading 2. Roll the cookie dough balls extra tall. After the dough has chilled, scoop out a ball of dough thatâ€™s 3 Tablespoons for XL cookies or about 2 heaping Tablespoons (1.75 ounces or 50g) for medium/large cookies. I usually use this medium cookie scoop and make it a heaping scoop. But making the cookie dough balls tall and textured, rather than wide and smooth, is my tried-and-true trick that results in thick and textured-looking cookies. Weâ€™re talking thick bakery-style cookies with wrinkly, textured tops. Your cookie dough should look less like balls and more like, well, lumpy columns, LOL. this medium cookie scoop Watch the video below to see how I shape them. I also demonstrate how I use a spoon to reshape them during baking if I see theyâ€™re spreading too much. Another Success Tip: When you remove the cookie dough from the refrigerator, the dough may be slightly crumbly. Scooping and then shaping it with warm hands keeps it intact. Tools I Recommend for This Recipe Iâ€™ve tested many baking tools and these are the exact products I use, trust, and recommend to readers. Youâ€™ll need most of these tools when making sugar cookies and snickerdoodles, too! sugar cookies snickerdoodles Baking Sheets Baking Sheets Silicone Baking Mats or Parchment Sheets Silicone Baking Mats Parchment Sheets Medium Cookie Scoop Medium Cookie Scoop Cooling Racks Cooling Racks See More: Best Cookie Baking Tools and 8 Best Baking Pans Cookie Baking Tools Best Baking Pans Can I Freeze This Cookie Dough? Yes, absolutely. After chilling, sometimes I roll the cookie dough into balls and freeze them in a large zipped-top bag. Then I bake them straight from the freezer, keeping them in the oven for an extra minute. This way you can bake just a couple of cookies whenever the craving hits. (The chewy chocolate chip cookie craving is a hard one to ignore.) If youâ€™re curious about freezing cookie dough, hereâ€™s my How to Freeze Cookie Dough page. How to Freeze Cookie Dough Facebook member Leigh commented: These are the only CC cookies Iâ€™ve made for years (and this recipe is how I came to be such a fan of SBA!) This recipe worked great when I lived in Denver and had issues with baking at altitude, and itâ€™s still our favorite now that weâ€™re back at sea level. I usually make 4x-6x batches and freeze tons of cookie balls to bake later. In Short, Here Are the Secrets to Soft & Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies: Cornstarch helps product soft and thick cookies. Using more brown sugar than white sugarÂ results in a moister, softer cookie. An extra egg yolkÂ increases chewiness. Rolling the cookie dough balls to be tall and lumpy instead of wide and smooth gives the cookies a bakery-style textured thickness. Itâ€™s a trick we use for cake batter chocolate chip cookies, too.  cake batter chocolate chip cookies Using melted butter (and slightly more flour to counteract the liquid) increases chewiness.

 Description These super soft and chewy chocolate chip cookies are the most popular cookie recipe on my website for good reason. Melted butter, more brown sugar than white sugar, cornstarch, and an extra egg yolk guarantee the absolute chewiest chocolate chip cookie texture. The cookie dough is slick and requires chilling prior to shaping the cookies. Review recipe notes before beginning. Ingredients 2 and 1/4 cups (280g) all-purpose flourÂ (spooned & leveled) spooned & leveled 1 teaspoon baking soda 1 and 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch* 1/2 teaspoon salt 3/4 cup (170g / 12 Tbsp) unsalted butter, melted & cooled 5 minutes* 3/4 cup (150g) packed light or dark brown sugar 1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar 1 large egg + 1 egg yolk, at room temperature 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 1 and 1/4 cups (225g) semi-sweet chocolate chips or chocolate chunks Instructions Whisk the flour, baking soda, cornstarch, and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk the melted butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar together until no brown sugar lumps remain. Whisk in the egg and egg yolk. Finally, whisk in the vanilla extract. The mixture will be thin. Pour into dry ingredients and mix together with a large spoon or rubber spatula. The dough will be very soft, thick, and appear greasy. Fold in the chocolate chips. The chocolate chips may not stick to the dough because of the melted butter, but do your best to combine them.  Cover the dough tightly and chill in the refrigerator for at least 2â€“3 hours or up to 3 days. I highly recommend chilling the cookie dough overnight for less spreading. Take the dough out of the refrigerator and allow it to slightly soften at room temperature for 10 minutes. Preheat oven to 325Â°F (163Â°C). Line large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside. Using a cookie scoop or Tablespoon measuring spoon, measure 3 scant Tablespoons (about 2 ounces, or 60g) of dough for XL cookies or 2 heaping Tablespoons (about 1.75 ounces, or 50g) of dough for medium/large cookies. Roll into a ball, making sure the shape is taller rather than wideâ€”almost like a cylinder. This helps the cookies bake up thicker. Repeat with remaining dough. Place 8â€“9 balls of dough onto each cookie sheet.Â  Bake the cookies for 12â€“13 minutes or until the edges are very lightly browned. (XL cookies can take closer to 14 minutes.) The centers will look very soft, but the cookies will continue to set as they cool. Cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, press a few extra chocolate chips into the tops of the warm cookies. This is optional and only for looks. After 10 minutes of cooling on the baking sheets, transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool completely.Â  Cookies stay fresh covered at room temperature for up to 1 week. Notes Make Ahead & Freezing Instructions: You can make the cookie dough and chill it in the refrigerator for up to 2â€“3 days. Allow to come to room temperature then continue with step 5. Baked cookies freeze well for up to 3 months. Unbaked cookie dough balls freeze well for up to 3 months. Bake frozen cookie dough balls for an extra minute, no need to thaw.

The cookies are still very soft. Egg & Egg Yolk: Room temperature egg + egg yolk are best. Typically, if a recipe calls for room temperature or melted butter, itâ€™s good practice to use room temperature eggs as well. To bring eggs to room temperature quickly, simply place the whole eggs into a glass of warm water for 5 minutes. Can I add nuts or different add-ins? Yes, absolutely. As long as the total amount of add-ins is around 1 â€“ 1 and 1/4 cups, you can add anything including chopped nuts, M&Ms, white chocolate chips, dried cranberries, chopped peanut butter cups, etc. I love them with 3/4 cup (135g) butterscotch morsels and 1/2 cup (100g) Reeseâ€™s Pieces. You could even add 1/2 cupÂ (80g)Â sprinkles to make a sprinkle chocolate chip cookie.
